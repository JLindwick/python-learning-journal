# About Me
`Hey there, I'm Justine. I've been into programming since I was 13, and I really enjoy working with Node.js and React.js. I'm aiming to get a degree in computer science. For this course, I just want to deepen my knowledge in the field. I've always had a passion for coding because it offers some of the best puzzles to solve, and that's a big part of why I love programming.`
